**Sakamoto** is a basic and somewhat adorable **web content management system** written in **Python**. It was designed to be easy to understand, perform as fast as possible and to utilize and intuitive tree-menu system whereby all pages and links on a site are organized into a single tree/index.

This repository contains Sakamoto's **core framework**, default themes and default templates. A theme system is already available, and extensions may be on the way soon.

## ðŸš€&nbsp; Installation and Configuration

Installing Sakamoto is usually fairly easy, but it depends on whether you intend to use it in a production environment or if you intend to contribute to the code.

Instructions for popular distributions have been provided here. You can adapt them for your own pretty easily.

### Fedora Server 28+ OR Fedora Workstation 28+

Installation:
```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip python3-devel python3-setuptools python3-virtualenv libev-devel git

# Clone from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/naphthasl/sakamoto sakamoto

# Create virtual environment
mkdir sakamoto/environment
virtualenv sakamoto/environment
cd sakamoto

# Activate virtual environment
source environment/bin/activate

# Install more dependencies within virtual environment
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Perform first-time launch, which will create the primary config file
python3 sakamoto.py

# Edit the config file (set default admin details, configure database access)
nano config.toml

# Deactivate virtual environment
deactivate
```

Running:
```bash
source environment/bin/activate
python3 sakamoto.py
deactivate
```

### Debian-based

Same instructions as Fedora, except replace the "Install Dependencies" stage with the following:
```bash

sudo apt install software-properties-common git
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.8
sudo apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev libsqlite3-dev wget libbz2-dev libev-dev
